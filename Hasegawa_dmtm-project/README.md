## Final Project

The purpose of this project is to see if text mining techniques can ease better analysis for categorizing movies with just the `Descriptions` while ignoring the `Genre`from the dataset, `IMDB_movies.csv`, which is stored under the dataframe variable, `movies_desc`. 

- Tokenization and TF-DF was used to increase efficiency to analyze term frequencies in movie `Descriptions`, so that the conceptual theme of a movie franchise would be determined even if a person has never watched any of the films. 
- Create topic mixtures with Topic Modeling to identify the most dominant themes within blockbuster movies.
- Sentimental Analysis focused on Movies with Sentimetal Clusters that were using `bing` and `nrc` lexicons to see how `Sentiment` affects `Rating` and `Revenue`. 
- The network of bigrams for the Movies dataset help summarize how frequented Movie `Description` word-terms create term relationships and how they connect to other movies.
